We are thankful to the theme for the following.

* Simple [custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy
* Author panel, with social links

## Getting Started

Neo-HPSTR takes advantage of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide(Original)](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/theme-setup/) for more information.
