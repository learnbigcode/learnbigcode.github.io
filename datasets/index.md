Sharing datasets in a research community has a number of advantages. It allows for meaningful comparison between systems and enables researchers to spend more time on developing state-of-the-art methods as opposed to collecting and cleaning data.

In case a dataset is useful for a specific task, a <a href="/challenges">challenge</a> can be created such that other people try to solve the same problem.

The datasets here should not require sign-up for web services or writing emails to their authors or third parties.

<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="naturalize">Java Variable and Method Naming Dataset and Embeddings</h1>

<p>This dataset includes the Java source code and JSON serialized files containing their tokens and the locations of the tokens that refer to the same variable. It also contains pre-trained embeddings for variable and method names.<br/>

<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="estimatingTypesDataset">Estimating Types in Stripped Binaries Dataset</h1>

<p>This dataset includes 20 stripped binaries used as benchmarks for evaluate estimation of object types and virtual function call targets. 
It also contains the ground-truth determined for the object types. 
The binaries were collected from publically availalble open-source projects, compiled with default optimizations and stripped.
The dataset is provided in the form of dumps of MongoDB databases holding the data (see README for further details).
